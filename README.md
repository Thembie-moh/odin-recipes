Recipe Website Project
This project showcases a simple website I created to practice my HTML skills. It includes basic web pages that feature some of my favorite recipes.

Project Overview
In this project, I focused on:

     Creating directories through the terminal and managing files within a cloned repository.
     Writing and structuring an HTML index page.
     Using both ordered and unordered lists to   organize recipe information effectively.
This project provided an opportunity to enhance my understanding of foundational web development skills and improve my HTML proficiency.
